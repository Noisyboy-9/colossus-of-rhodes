# Colossus Of Rhodes
Where scheduling algorithms are grown and tests.

In Fall 2022, I picked operating systems course under supervision [Dr. Zarandi](https://aut.ac.ir/cv/2188/Hamid-Reza-Zarandi?slc_lang=en&&cv=2188&mod=scv), and as a part of a research project I was tasked to 
implement a simulator of operating systems and underlying hardware that you can define new scheduling algorithms and 
test them. <br>
This project aims to be a framework for implementing and testing different scheduling algorithms and be a basis for 
comparison of them, also in addition to that there is the possibility to expand the framework to have multiple 
dispatchers, queues, long-term & mid-term scheduler etc.
